# Machine-Learning-Project

This is a project done in fulfillment for the final project in the Introduction to Machine Learning course (CS 480/ 680) done at the University of Waterloo.

This project was looking at the implementation of ABC and PSO as optimization techniques for deep neural networks (DNNs). The implementations were run on 3 data sets of varying sizes, each with a different amount of hidden layers.

It can be shown that the implementations worked best on the smaller data sets, even with more hidden layers

My implementations used pre-existing algorithms that I modified for this purpose. The algorithm for PSO was shown to outperform ABC in both speed and performance, which contradicts some of the studies that are talked about in my report.

This could easily be due to mistakes in my implementation, or parameters that could use more tuning.
